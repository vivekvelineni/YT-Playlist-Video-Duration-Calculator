# YT-Playlist-Video-Duration-Calculator
This is a Calculator that finds the duration of a Playlist/Video at various lengths.

This website runs completely on the frontend & uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Regex & Youtube API. 

This website doesn't use any libraries or frameworks

I have created this website without having any prior experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Regex & Youtube API. I have taken the help of Google, Stackoverflow, W3 Schools, GeeksforGeeks and other similar websites to build this website.
